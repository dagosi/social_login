# SocialLogin

This gem help you to login to different social networks (Academic project).
This is a basic configuration gem that use omniauth to make the authentication against social networks such as twitter or facebook.
Some code generated by the gem and such other configuration where taked for railscast.com (Thanks Ryan!).
You can improve and compleate this generated code with the omniauth episodes in http://railstcasts.com.

To use this gem, I assume that you have devise correctly configured. If not, I suggest you take a look at [devise configuration.](http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise?view=asciicast)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'social_login'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install social_login

## Usage

After install the gem, you have to run the three generators that the gem provides.

First run the basic install generator:

    $ rails g social_login:install

# Omniauth basic configuration
This generator will create the `omniauth.rb` file in the `config/initializers` directory. This file seems like this:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :twitter, 'KEY', 'SECRET'
      provider :facebook, 'KEY', 'SECRET', { :scope => 'email, offline_access, user_photos, publish_stream', :client_options => { :ssl => { :ca_path => "/etc/ssl/certs" } } }
      provider :linkedin, 'KEY', 'SECRET'
    end

There is a basic configuration when you have to put your social networks credentials. So, first you have to create a twitter application for instance (http://dev.twitter.com).
Here you can add several providers, whatever you want, but you have to add their specific omniauth gem as well.

After this generation, this generator will create the callback route that you need to handle when the authentication against the social network is successful. This will add the below route to your `config/routes.rb` file:

     #match '/auth/:provider/callback' => 'authentications#create'

This is just a comment. Keep in mind that the `AuthenticationsController` is just an example here.  

This generator also add the default gem dependencies to your `Gemfile`, so then, you have to run your bundle command.

    gem 'omniauth-twitter'
    gem 'omniauth-facebook'
    gem 'omniauth-linkedin'

Later:

    $ bundle install

With this, you shall have your omniauth basic configuration done.
