# SocialLogin

This gem help you to login to different social networks (Academic project).
This is a basic configuration gem that use omniauth to make the authentication against social networks such as twitter or facebook.
Some code generated by the gem and such other configuration where taked for railscast.com (Thanks Rayn!).
You can improve and compleate this generated code with the omniauth episodes in [http://railstcasts.com].

To use this gem, I assume that you have devise correctly configured. If not, I suggest that you have to start with this [devise configuration.](http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise?view=asciicast)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'social_login'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install social_login

## Usage

After install the gem, you have to run the three generators that the gem provides.

First run the basic install generator:

    $ rails g social_login:install

# Omniauth basic configuration
This generator will create the `omniauth.rb` file in the `config/initializers` directory. This file seems like this:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :twitter, 'KEY', 'SECRET'
      provider :facebook, 'KEY', 'SECRET', { :scope => 'email, offline_access, user_photos, publish_stream', :client_options => { :ssl => { :ca_path => "/etc/ssl/certs" } } }
      provider :linkedin, 'KEY', 'SECRET'
    end

There is a basic configuration when you have to put your social networks credentials. So, first you have to create a twitter applications for instance (dev.twitter.com).
